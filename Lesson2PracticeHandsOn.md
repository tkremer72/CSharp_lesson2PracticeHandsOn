# Part 1

# Create a program which prints the ticket prices for a user:

     If the user is a senior citizen (they are 65 years of age or older), they receive a discounted price of $7 per ticket.
     If the user is 12 years of age or younger, they receive a discounted price of $8 per ticket.
     Otherwise, they will pay $10.
     Age Range	Price
     0-12	$8
     13-64	$10
     65 & Above	$7
     Below is starter code to help you get started. Give the variable age any value you would like to test your code:

     int age;

     // if senior citizen, pay $7

     // if child, pay $8

     // everyone else, pay $10

# Tip!
     Print the ticket prices to the console.

# Part 2
#    Add the following to your program that prints the ticket prices for a user:

     Create a new variable named isStudent that is of type boolean.
     Set this to true to test your code.
     Add another condition to the statement(s) checking for the age of a child. It should now be the following:
     If the user is 12 years of age or younger OR a student, they receive a discounted price of $8 per ticket.
     Age Range	Price
     Student	$8
     0-12	$8
     13-64	$10
     65 & Above	$7
#     Starter Code:

int age;

// if senior citizen, pay $7

// if student, pay $8

// if child, pay $8

// everyone else, pay $10
