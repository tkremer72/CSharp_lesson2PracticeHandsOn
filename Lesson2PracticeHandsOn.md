# Part 1

# Create a program which prints the ticket prices for a user:

     If the user is a senior citizen (they are 65 years of age or older), they receive a discounted price of $7 per ticket.
     If the user is 12 years of age or younger, they receive a discounted price of $8 per ticket.
     Otherwise, they will pay $10.
     Age Range	Price
     0-12	$8
     13-64	$10
     65 & Above	$7
     Below is starter code to help you get started. Give the variable age any value you would like to test your code:

     int age;

     // if senior citizen, pay $7

     // if child, pay $8

     // everyone else, pay $10

# Tip!
     Print the ticket prices to the console.
